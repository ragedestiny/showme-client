# Show ME
> Show ME is used as a tool to help students write vivid and exciting sentences. Each day of the challenge, students will be given a different simple tell sentence and the goal is for the student to formulate and come up a more descriptive sentence. Show ME will keep track of the submitted sentences and students can edit them at any time. This is the frontend client.

## General Information
- As a tutor, my goal is to help students achieve greater heights in their English class. One way to do this is to write better and more descriptively rather than simple and plainly. Before creating this web app, my students would have to keep track of their sentences on a standard paper notebook. The paper notebook would eventually get lost and it was hard to keep track of what their sentences were. In order to make this exercise more steamline and efficient, creating a web app was the way to go.
